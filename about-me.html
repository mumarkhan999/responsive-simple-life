                        My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>I used to be a pack rat.</b> I had so many things
                        that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I
                        couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too
                        much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home
                        that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                        relationship.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b
                            >I was on verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                            everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in
                            the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller
                            apartment, and I quit my job.</b
                        >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in
                        suc a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it
                        worked.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
                        better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and
                        I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With how much it turned my life around,
                        <b
                            >I felt I had to choice but to start sharing how I
                            did it,</b
                        >
                        and how others can benefit from living a simple life as
                        well, which is why I started this site!
