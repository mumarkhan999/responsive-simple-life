                                Life can get complicated really qucickly, but it
                                doesn't have to be! There are many ways to
                                simplify your life, a few of which we've
                                explored in the past. This week we're taking a
                                bit of a approach though, in how you find
                                simplicity in the life you already living.

                                Food is a very important part of everyone's
                                life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat
                                healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is
                                to keep your cooking nice and simple.

                                Work is often a major source of stress. People
                                get frustraed, it ruins their relationship with
                                others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your
                                work life as simple as possible, it will help
                                balance everything out.

                                A home isn't a home until you've decorated a
                                little. People either don't decorate, or they go
                                overboard and it doesn't have the impact they
                                were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw
                                the eye where you want it to and make things pop
                                like never before.
